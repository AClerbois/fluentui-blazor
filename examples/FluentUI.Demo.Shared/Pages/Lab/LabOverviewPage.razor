    <h1>Incubation Lab Overview</h1>
</div>

<p>
    The incubation lab is were we test things out. Some of the expirements might make it into the library, others end up in the trashcan.
</p>
<p>

    As these components are not part of the official library (yet), they are not included in the NuGet package. Also, note that we only 
    offer support on a best effort base.
    <br />
    We hope you will help us test-drive the components, both here in the demo environment but also in your own projects, and give us 
    feedback (at our <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/fast-blazor/discussions">repo's discussion board'</a>).
</p>
<p>
    Most components will show download links for the Razor (<code>.razor</code>), C# (<code>.cs</code>) and CSS (<code>.css</code>) 
    files (if applicable for that specific component). This makes it easy to test the components inside of your own projects.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Please be aware that if you download the files to use in your own project, you need to replace the default <code>FluentUI.Demo.Shared</code> namespace with your own project's namespace'</strong>
